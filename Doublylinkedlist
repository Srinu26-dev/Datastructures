doubly linked list 
each node has three parts
one info part , two link parts
one link point to next node
one link point to previous node
for the first node previous link is NULL
for the last node next  link is NULL

struct node 
{
    struct node *prev;
    int info ;
    struct node *next;
};

Advantages
------------
can be traversed in both forward and backward directions
implementation of some operatins easier;insertion and deletion can be done with a single pointer

Disadvantages
----------------
Extra space is required for storing previous pointer
While inserting and deleting, some extra steps are required for maintaining the previous pointer
