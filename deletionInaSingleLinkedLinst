Deletion of the first node
Deletion of the only node
Deletion in between the list
Deletion at the end

pointer temp - point to node that is to be deleted
Rearrange Links - remove node logically
free(temp) 

Deletion of the first node
-------------------------
temp =start;
start = start->link
free(temp)

Deletion of the only node
------------------------
temp = start
start = start->link
free(temp)

Deletion in between the list
--------------------------
make pointer point to predecessor of the node(which is going to deleted)
temp = p->link;
p->link=temp->link;
free(temp)

  
Deletion at the end
---------------------
make pointer point to predecessor of the last node
temp = p->link;
p->link=temp->link;
free(temp)
